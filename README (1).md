# Airbnb Data Analysis







## üìå Project Overview
This project explores an Airbnb dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract insights, clean data, and visualize trends. The goal is to analyze pricing, availability, and trends across different neighborhoods and room types.
## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values: Replaced NaNs in reviews per month and last review.

Removed duplicates to ensure data integrity.
